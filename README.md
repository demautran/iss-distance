# ISS Distance

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Description

This app calculates the distance from the User (using his IP address - thus, tecnically, the distance from his active network) to the ISS' current location using the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).

## Motivation

While learning React's basics, I was tasked with creating a simple App with public APIs. This is the result

### Shortcomings

Troubleshooting has been problematic given the accumulated knowledge up to this point. I have intentionally increased the difficulty level of the assignment to above my knowledge. Thus, during development, some of the code has been altered and does not reflect the best practices of code and design.

However, given the nature of this project, I have decided to leave it as is (functional) and proceed to my next project. I might return to make this code better.
